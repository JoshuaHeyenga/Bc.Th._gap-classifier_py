# Gap Classifier Project

## Overview
This project is part of a Bachelor's thesis exploring the impact of introducing a synthetic **"Gap" class** between labeled data classes. The goal is to analyze how adding this intermediate class affects classifier performance and decision boundaries.

The project involves:
- Identifying **uncertain** data points between labeled classes.
- Assigning these points to a new **"Gap" class**.
- Evaluating the impact on classifier performance.
- Developing strategies for **synthetic data generation** in uncertain regions.

## Objectives
1. **Introduce a "Gap" Class**: Identify and assign uncertain data points to a separate class.
2. **Analyze Classifier Performance**: Compare model behavior with and without the Gap class.
3. **Explore Synthetic Data Generation**:
   - Midpoint selection between data points of different classes.
   - Distance-based sampling to generate artificial points.
   - Hypersphere sampling for diverse synthetic data.
4. **Apply to Multiple Datasets**: Generalize the approach beyond toy datasets.
